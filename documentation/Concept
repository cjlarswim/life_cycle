The functioning of the System is straightforward and can be observed in the graphic below. While the cyclist is approaching the crossing (here on a sight protected bike path) they will enter the camera’s field of vision. Once the cyclist has entered the camera detects and tracks the cyclist. During setup a “trigger line” has been established. Once this line has been crossed by the cyclist the camera database entries increases by +1, this is the trigger which is sent wirelessly to the warning signal positioned at the crossing visible by turning vehicles. 
Hence, the driver is aided in monitoring the crossing intelligently. The smart signal takes out guessing from the turning process and warns only if a cyclist approaches with enough speed to actually cross the intersection during the turning process.
