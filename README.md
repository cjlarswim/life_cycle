# _life_cycle()_
### A machine vision enabled intelligent traffic signal warning right turning drivers from crossing cyclist. 

The essential idea of _Life_Cycle()_ is to reduce traffic accidents involving cars and bicycles in unclear turning situations. Hence, reducing the number of hurt or killed bicyclists in the city. _Life_Cycle()_ is a camera based, machine vision enabled system running the Darknet YOLO Framework, which can identify incoming cyclist while approaching an intersection and warn turning vehicles only if an accident is about to occur.
The system is ought to be implemented where traditional systems, such as mirrors or protected bike lanes fail to work. 

This system is especially valuable for following situations 
- the bike lane cannot be observed directly by the car driver :truck:
- at temporary construction sites :construction:
- in situations where the bike path is not observable by turning assistants :point_right:

While turning assistants are a valid option for some traffic participants (i.e truck drivers), only 5% of all trucks on German roads are equipped with such a system. It will take another 20 years or so for the car and truck population to adapt a great enough turning assistant density to have a significant effect on safety on city roads for cyclist.
Our system can be implemented quickly and at relatively low cost, hence, creating a higher level of safety at crossings which have been identified as dangerous.

### Other Use Cases
The systems main application is to warn drivers during the turning process. However, other applications can be realized using the exact same setup. 
- Counting passing traffic participants at crossing (quantitativ)
- Accident forensics
- Observe behavior at intersection to train neural networks for more advanced predictive warning signals
